# Thorax - Short Project Descriptions

## 🎯 One-Liner (for forms with character limits)

**Autonomous AI agent that monitors Neo smart contracts 24/7, detects security breaches using SpoonOS + Gemini LLM, and automatically alerts owners before exploits occur.**

---

## 📝 Short Description (100-150 words)

**Thorax** is an autonomous AI-powered security agent built with **SpoonOS** that monitors Neo blockchain smart contracts in real-time. Using **Google Gemini LLM** for intelligent reasoning, Thorax analyzes contract events, detects security breaches, and automatically sends multi-modal alerts (email + AI voice) to contract owners—all without human intervention.

The agent operates 24/7, scanning the Neo blockchain every 30 seconds, evaluating each event against known attack patterns, and making autonomous decisions about threat severity. With a minimalistic web dashboard, users can register contracts, view AI-generated risk assessments, and monitor real-time security events.

Built for the **AI Agent with Web3** track, Thorax solves the billion-dollar problem of smart contract exploits through truly autonomous, intelligent monitoring—not just automation, but AI-driven decision-making that protects DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and DAOs on Neo.

**Thorax: Autonomous AI Security Agent for Neo Blockchain**

Smart contract exploits cost the blockchain industry over $3 billion annually. Manual monitoring is impractical for 24/7 blockchain activity. **Thorax** solves this with an autonomous AI agent that never sleeps.

**How It Works:**

1. **Intelligent Analysis**: Users register Neo smart contracts. SpoonOS AI agents analyze the ABI, identifying dangerous methods and vulnerabilities. Google Gemini LLM generates risk scores (0-10) and identifies specific breach vectors.

2. **Autonomous Monitoring**: The agent continuously polls Neo RPC nodes, scanning blocks for contract events. No human intervention required—fully autonomous operation across multiple contracts.

3. **AI-Driven Detection**: Each event is analyzed by SpoonOS agents using Gemini LLM. The AI evaluates event patterns, determines if threats exist, classifies severity (low/medium/high/critical), and generates actionable recommendations.

4. **Automated Alerts**: Immediate email notifications to contract owners. Optional AI-generated voice alerts via ElevenLabs for critical events. Real-time dashboard with event streaming.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ True autonomy with AI decision-making (not just automation)
- ✅ SpoonOS AI Agent Framework integration (required for hackathon)
- ✅ Native Neo N3 blockchain support (testnet/mainnet)
- ✅ Multi-modal alerts (email + voice synthesis)
- ✅ Legal compliance analysis
- ✅ Production-ready implementation

**Use Cases:** DeFi protocol security, NFT marketplace protection, DAO governance oversight, token contract auditing.

**Tech Stack:** SpoonOS, Google Gemini, Neo N3, Next.js 16, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, ElevenLabs.

Thorax represents the future of Web3 security: autonomous, intelligent, and proactive.
