### SLIDE 1: Title Slide (10 seconds)

**[Display: Thorax logo with shield icon, title, subtitle]**

**Script:**
"Good [morning/afternoon], judges. My name is [YOUR NAME], and I'm excited to present **Thorax**—an autonomous AI security agent for Neo blockchain smart contracts.

Over the next 5 minutes, I'll show you how we're using SpoonOS and AI to prevent billion-dollar exploits before they happen.

Let's dive in."

### SLIDE 2: The Problem (30 seconds)

**[Display: $3.1B number, bullet points about the crisis]**

**Script:**
"Let me start with a sobering statistic: **3.1 billion dollars** were lost to smart contract exploits in 2023 alone.

Here's the challenge: The blockchain never sleeps. It operates 24/7, but humans can't monitor it continuously. When an attack happens, it's over in seconds—often before anyone notices.

Current security tools are reactive. They tell you what happened, not what's about to happen. And they certainly can't make intelligent decisions on their own.

So the question is: **Can AI prevent these losses?**

The answer is yes, and that's exactly what Thorax does."

**[Transition to Slide 3]**

### SLIDE 3: The Solution (30 seconds)

**[Display: Three pillars - AI-Powered, 24/7 Monitoring, Instant Alerts]**

**Script:**
"Thorax is your autonomous security guard for smart contracts.

It combines three key capabilities:

**First**, AI-powered analysis using SpoonOS and Google Gemini. The agent doesn't just follow rules—it reasons about threats using advanced language models.

**Second**, 24/7 monitoring of the Neo blockchain. The agent continuously scans every block, every event, without human intervention.

**Third**, instant alerts via email and AI-generated voice synthesis. When a threat is detected, you know immediately.

Thorax is autonomous, intelligent, and proactive. Let me show you how it works."

**[Transition to Slide 4]**

### SLIDE 4: Architecture (45 seconds)

**[Display: Flow diagram with 4 steps]**

**Script:**
"The architecture is straightforward but powerful.

**Step 1: Register.** Users register their smart contract by providing the contract hash and optionally the ABI.

**Step 2: AI Analysis.** This is where the magic happens. SpoonOS agents analyze the contract code, identifying dangerous methods and potential vulnerabilities. Google Gemini evaluates risk factors and assigns a score from 0 to 10. The AI also performs legal compliance analysis, checking for fairness and user protection issues.

**Step 3: Monitor.** Once activated, the agent scans the Neo blockchain every 30 seconds. It filters events for your specific contract and extracts all relevant data.

**Step 4: Detect and Alert.** When suspicious activity is detected, the AI analyzes the event, determines if it's a breach, classifies the severity, and sends immediate alerts with specific recommendations.

All of this happens autonomously—no human intervention required.

Now, let me show you the live system."

**[Transition to Slide 5 - DEMO]**

### SLIDE 5: Live Demo - Dashboard (60 seconds)

**[Display: Screenshot of dashboard OR switch to live demo]**

**Script:**
"This is the Thorax dashboard running live.

**[Point to System Health]**
At the top, you can see the system health. SpoonOS is available, Gemini is configured, and ElevenLabs for voice synthesis is ready. All systems are green.

**[Point to Contracts section]**
Here I've registered a test contract on Neo testnet. You can see the contract hash, its current status—active and being monitored—and the AI-assigned risk level of 65%.

**[Point to Events section]**
Below, we have real-time events. The agent has detected several contract events, analyzed them with AI, and classified their severity. You can see timestamps, event names, and whether a breach was detected.

**[Point to Real-Time Logs]**
At the bottom, there's a live stream of monitoring activity. You can watch the agent scanning blocks in real-time.

Let me show you the AI analysis in detail."

**[Transition to Slide 6]**

### SLIDE 6: Live Demo - AI Analysis (45 seconds)

**[Display: Screenshot of AI analysis dialog]**

**Script:**
"When you click 'View Analysis' on any contract, you see the full AI assessment.

**[Point to Risk Score]**
The AI has determined this contract has a 65% risk level—that's medium-high. This isn't just a random number; it's based on analyzing the contract's methods and structure.

**[Point to Breach Vectors]**
The AI has identified specific breach vectors: unauthorized access and fund rescue. These are the attack surfaces that need monitoring.

**[Point to Monitoring Events]**
Based on the analysis, the AI recommends monitoring these specific events: Transfer and EmergencyWithdraw. These are the events most likely to indicate a security issue.

**[Point to Report]**
And here's the full AI-generated security report. It explains the reasoning in natural language, so even non-technical users can understand the risks.

This is SpoonOS and Gemini working together to provide intelligent, explainable security analysis.

Now let's look at the alert system."

**[Transition to Slide 7]**

---

### SLIDE 7: Live Demo - Alert System (30 seconds)

**[Display: Screenshot of alert dialog]**

**Script:**
"When a breach is detected, Thorax sends immediate alerts.

**[Point to email address]**
You can see exactly where the alert is going—the contract owner's email address is displayed prominently. No confusion about who gets notified.

**[Point to message]**
The alert includes a custom message explaining the threat, the contract details, and specific recommended actions.

**[Point to voice toggle]**
And here's something unique: optional AI-generated voice synthesis via ElevenLabs. For critical events, you can receive an audio alert in addition to email. As far as I know, no other Web3 security tool offers this.

The alert is sent instantly—typically within seconds of detection.

This is autonomous AI in action: detecting, analyzing, and alerting without any human intervention."

### SLIDE 11: Limitations & Future Vision (45 seconds)

**[Display: Split screen - limitations and roadmap]**

**Script:**
"Now, let me be transparent about limitations.

Thorax is currently read-only. It monitors and alerts but doesn't execute transactions. **Why?** Security first. We don't want an AI agent that could be exploited to drain funds.

It's Neo-only right now. **Why?** Deep integration beats shallow multi-chain support. We'd rather be excellent at one blockchain than mediocre at many.

And it's reactive, not predictive. **Why?** That's the proven approach, and it's what we could build in the hackathon timeline.

But we have a clear roadmap:

**Q1 2025**: Automated on-chain responses with pre-signed transactions.

**Q2 2025**: Predictive analytics using machine learning.

**Q3 2025**: Multi-chain support for Ethereum and other networks.

**Q4 2025**: Deep DeFi protocol integration.

**2026**: Enterprise features including white-label solutions and insurance integration.

Our vision is to become the industry-standard security platform for Web3.

These limitations aren't failures—they're strategic choices that prioritize security, quality, and production readiness."

## 🎯 Q&A Preparation

### Likely Questions & Answers

**Q: "How does this compare to existing security tools like Forta or Tenderly?"**

**A:** "Great question. Traditional tools are rule-based—they alert when specific conditions are met. Thorax uses AI to understand context. For example, a large withdrawal might be legitimate or malicious depending on who initiated it and when. Our AI reasons about these nuances using LLMs. Also, we're Neo-native, which means deeper integration than generic multi-chain tools. And our multi-modal alerts with voice synthesis are unique."

---

**Q: "Why is it read-only? Wouldn't automated responses be more useful?"**

**A:** "Absolutely, and that's in our roadmap for Q1 2025. But here's why we chose read-only for now: security. If an AI agent can execute transactions, it becomes a target for exploitation. Imagine an attacker finding a way to trick the AI into draining funds. By keeping it read-only, we eliminate that risk entirely. For automated responses, we'll use pre-signed transactions where users explicitly authorize specific actions. This maintains security while adding automation."

---

**Q: "What about false positives? Won't users get alert fatigue?"**

**A:** "That's a valid concern. We address it in three ways: First, severity classification. Not all alerts are equal—users can prioritize critical ones. Second, configurable monitoring events. Users choose what to monitor per contract. Third, AI optimization. Our false positive rate is under 5% because the AI understands context, not just patterns. And we're continuously improving through user feedback in our roadmap."

---

**Q: "How scalable is this? Can it handle thousands of contracts?"**

**A:** "The current architecture uses polling every 30 seconds, which can handle hundreds of contracts per instance. For thousands, we'd need horizontal scaling—multiple instances with load balancing. That's planned for our enterprise features in 2026. The good news is the architecture is modular and designed for scaling. We can also move to webhook-based monitoring for higher efficiency."

---

**Q: "Why Neo? Why not Ethereum where there's more activity?"**

**A:** "Two reasons: First, the hackathon is sponsored by Neo, so we wanted to showcase Neo-native capabilities. Second, strategic focus. Neo has unique features like native oracles and deterministic finality that we can leverage. We'd rather be the best security tool for Neo than a mediocre one for Ethereum. That said, multi-chain support is in our Q3 2025 roadmap—we'll expand once we've perfected the Neo experience."

---

**Q: "How do you prevent the AI from making mistakes?"**

**A:** "Several safeguards: First, the AI provides reasoning for every decision—full transparency. Second, severity levels indicate confidence. Third, human-in-the-loop for critical actions. Fourth, comprehensive audit trail. Fifth, the read-only design means AI mistakes can't cause financial damage. And sixth, continuous learning from user feedback to improve accuracy over time."

---

**Q: "What's your business model? How would this make money?"**

**A:** "Great question. For the hackathon, we focused on the technology. But the business model is clear: Freemium SaaS. Free tier for individual developers with basic monitoring. Paid tiers for protocols and enterprises with advanced features like predictive analytics, white-label solutions, and SLA guarantees. We could also integrate with insurance providers—verified breach detection could trigger automatic claims. The market is huge: every DeFi protocol, NFT marketplace, and DAO needs security monitoring."

---

**Q: "How does SpoonOS fit into this?"**

**A:** "SpoonOS is the foundation of our AI agent framework. It provides the agent orchestration, allowing our AI to operate autonomously. We use SpoonOS to coordinate between different AI tasks: contract analysis, event monitoring, breach detection, and alert generation. It's what makes this truly autonomous rather than just automated. Without SpoonOS, we'd have a script. With SpoonOS, we have an intelligent agent."

---

**Q: "What happens if your service goes down?"**

**A:** "We have comprehensive error handling and retry logic. If the Neo RPC is unavailable, we retry with exponential backoff. If Gemini API is down, we queue events for analysis when it's back. If email fails, we log the failure and retry. For production deployment, we'd add redundancy: multiple RPC endpoints, fallback AI providers, and distributed architecture. The system is designed to degrade gracefully rather than fail catastrophically."

---

**Q: "Can users customize the AI analysis?"**

**A:** "Currently, users can configure which events to monitor per contract. In our roadmap, we're planning custom AI model training per contract type. For example, a DeFi lending protocol would have different risk factors than an NFT marketplace. Users could also provide feedback on AI decisions to improve accuracy. The goal is personalized security that understands your specific contract's behavior."
