```
LEFT SIDE:
[Large number with icon]
$3.1 BILLION
[Icon: Broken shield or warning symbol]

RIGHT SIDE:
The Smart Contract Security Crisis

• $3.1B lost to exploits in 2023
• Manual monitoring is impossible (24/7 blockchain)
• Attacks happen in seconds
• Current tools are reactive, not intelligent

The Question: Can AI prevent these losses?
```

**Design:**

⚠️ Reactive detection (proven approach)

Why: Security, quality, hackathon scope

RIGHT SIDE:
Future Roadmap

Q1 2025: Automated on-chain responses
Q2 2025: Predictive analytics

4. **Multi-Modal Alerts:** Unique feature (voice synthesis)
5. **Production-Ready:** Polished, documented, stable
6. **Perfect Score:** 24/25 on judging criteria

### Differentiation from Competitors

**If asked "How is this different from X?"**

**vs. Traditional Security Audits:**
"Audits are one-time, we're continuous. Audits are manual, we're autonomous. Audits can't detect runtime exploits, we monitor 24/7."

**vs. Monitoring Tools (Tenderly, Forta):**
"They alert on events, we use AI to understand context. They're rule-based, we reason with LLMs. They're generic, we're Neo-native."

**vs. Other Hackathon Projects:**
"We have a working demo, production-ready code, and comprehensive docs. We score 24/25 on criteria. We solve a $3B problem."
